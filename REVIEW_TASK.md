# Code Review Exercise

Another engineer submitted the resend endpoint below as a PR for review. **It runs and
passes their manual test** - treat it as a real PR.

Review it as you would a teammate's: list the bugs, correctness issues, and
design problems you find, **ordered by severity**. Then pick the single most
important one and show how you'd fix it (a few lines or a short description is
fine).

You do **not** need to wire this code into your project, this is only a review
exercise. Add your findings to the bottom of this file.

> Context: requirements say resend must (a) only work for "Invitation Sent"
> referrals, (b) be rejected within 30s of the last send, enforced server-side,
> and (c) rotate the invite token so the old one stops working.

```python
# referrals/views.py
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import random

from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response

from .models import Referral


@api_view(["POST"])
def resend_invitation(request, pk):
    referral = Referral.objects.get(pk=pk)

    last_sent = request.data.get("last_sent_at")
    if last_sent:
        elapsed = datetime.now() - datetime.fromisoformat(last_sent)
        if elapsed < timedelta(seconds=30):
            return Response({"error": "Cannot resend within 30 seconds"})

    # rotate the token
    referral.token = str(random.randint(100000, 999999))
    referral.last_sent_at = datetime.now()
    referral.save()

    return Response({"status": "sent", "token": referral.token})
```

## Your review

> List issues, most severe first. Then fix the top one.

1. line 40: using `random` isn't secure, it should be generated preferably UUID.
2. it is reading the `last_sent_at` from the payload that user sent, not from the referral object in the DB, if it is kept that way user can send whichever value, affecting the logic.
3. method is missing a status check, the logic should only rotate the token if the referral status is `INVITATION_SENT`
4. line 44: it should not send the token in the response.
5. line 31: it is not handling a possible `DoesNotExist` exception.
6. line 35: it is using datetime instead of timezone.


> fix for top one:

```python
import uuid
...
referral.token = uuid.uuid4()
```
